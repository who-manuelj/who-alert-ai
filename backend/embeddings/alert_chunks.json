    "content": "Alert Summary This WHO Medical Product Alert refers to four batches of falsified HEALMOXY Capsules 500mg. The falsified products have been detected in Cameroon and the Central African Republic and were reported to the WHO in March 2025. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in genuine HEALMOXY capsules is amoxicillin: it is an antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including middle ear infections, pneumonia, skin infections, dental infections, and urinary tract infections. How to identify these falsified products These products are falsified as they deliberately misrepresent their identity, composition, and source. Analysis of samples of the falsified HEALMOXY found the capsules did not contain the stated active ingredient, specifically amoxicillin. At least two of the falsified products display inconsistent formats for manufacture and expiry dates. Dates on these falsified products are displayed as day/month/year in eight digits (e.g., 10/01/2027). Please refer to the Annex of this alert for full details of the falsified products. Risks These falsified products are unsafe and may pose significant health risks, particularly for severe infections or vulnerable individuals. The falsified HEALMOXY is not efficacious and should not be used to manage bacterial infections. Amoxicillin is an antibiotic that works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. Without the active ingredient, these products would not be effective in treating the infection, which could lead to the infection worsening or spreading. It is crucial to detect and remove any falsified HEALMOXY from circulation to prevent harm to patients. Advice to healthcare professionals, regulatory authorities and the public Health-care professionals should report any incident of adverse effects, lack of therapeutic effect or suspected falsification to the National Regulatory Authorities or National Pharmacovigilance Centre.

    "publishedDate": "31 March 2025",
    "content": "Product name All malaria rapid diagnostic tests WHO document identifier 2025/01 Date: 19 March 2025 Affected countries: Global Type of action: Advice regarding use of the device Description of the problem: In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed that various malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) showed faint positive test lines for patients with confirmed malaria infection. Incidents were reported in several countries for various products detecting both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, and products detecting Plasmodium falciparum and pan species. The faint test lines were predominantly observed for patients with low parasitemia (200 parasites/µl). However, some patients with higher parasitemia also generated faint test lines. More recent reports indicated that faint test lines have led to misdiagnosis and therefore delayed appropriate treatment. The manufacturers' investigations have followed internationally recognized practices. Description of risks: Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria can give false negative results, even for products found to have satisfactory performance based on criteria established by WHO. Faint test lines increase the risk of false negative test results being reported, which may lead to misdiagnosis, delay to diagnosis, and delay to treatment. In circumstances where misdiagnosis occurs, the potential for harm, such as death or serious deterioration in health, is increased. Actions to be taken by users/healthcare professionals: 1. Carefully follow the instructions for use of the product, specifically: Read any test line as positive, no matter how faint the test line. Fully fill and dispense completely the blood from the specimen transfer device. 2. Respect storage conditions for the test kit. 3. If the RDT results are negative and no alternative diagnosis is found, advise patients to return for re-evaluation or re-testing if their symptoms worsen or their condition does not improve. 4. Report any unusual testing results to the manufacturer, via their local authorized representative. Action to be taken by national malaria control programmes: Ensure conditions for transport and storage of RDTs respect manufacturer’s instructions for use throughout the lifespan of the product. Ensure up-to-date training and supervision of RDT users, and ensure users are specifically sensitized to the issues outlined in this information notice. Ensure end-users have normal or corrected visual acuity. Proactively reach out to testing sites to seek feedback on any unusual trends. Support manufacturers to conduct investigations of unusual testing results.

    "link": "https://www.who.int/news/item/12-03-2025-medical-product-alert-n-1-2024--falsified-(contaminated)-oxycontin-80mg",
    "publishedDate": "12 March 2025",
    "content": "Alert Summary This WHO Medical Product Alert refers to one batch of falsified OXYCONTIN 80mg (oxycodone hydrochloride). The falsified product was detected in the unregulated market in Switzerland and reported to WHO in February 2025 by the genuine manufacturer MUNDIPHARMA. The falsified product imitates genuine OXYCONTIN 80mg authorized in Poland. OXYCONTIN (oxycodone hydrochloride) is a semi-synthetic opioid indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. Laboratory testing of samples of the falsified product was conducted by the Drug Information Centre of the City of Zurich (DIZ), Switzerland. DIZ’s drug checking service determined that the tablets did not contain oxycodone, but a synthetic opioid likely to be a nitazene compound. Nitazene derivatives (e.g., metonitazene, isotonitazene, fluonitazene) are potent synthetic opioids, primarily used in research due to their high addiction potential and severe side-effects. These substances can be hundreds of times stronger than oxycodone, posing a high overdose risk. Limited information is available on their risks, toxicity, side-effects, and long-term consequences. How to identify this falsified product This product is confirmed as falsified because it deliberately misrepresents its identity, composition, and source. The falsified product imitates OXYCONTIN 80mg manufactured and marketed by MUNDIPHARMA in the Polish market. MUNDIPHARMA has confirmed that the product, subject of this alert, is falsified and was not produced by their company In identifying this product as falsified, the following visible discrepancies were noted The placement of the batch and expiry date on the falsified product is incorrect. On the falsified product the batch and expiry date are visible on the front side of the blister strip. Genuine OXYCONTIN has the batch and expiry date visible on the back of the blister strip. On the falsified product the expiry date is on the left and the batch number on the right. Genuine OXYCONTIN has the batch number on the left and the expiry date on the right. Please refer to the Annex of this Alert for full details of the falsified product. Risks This falsified product has been found to contain undeclared nitazene compounds, which pose a significant risk due to the high likelihood of adverse events, even in small doses. Nitazenes produce effects similar to other opioids. Their high potency carries a high risk of overdose and death. Using nitazene derivatives has been linked to several deaths. Mixing them with other depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines can be very dangerous, leading to severe effects like respiratory depression, low blood pressure, coma, or even death. This falsified product poses a particular risk to individuals with substance use disorders who may perceive this falsified product as a safe and quality assured medicine. Falsified OXYCONTIN has previously been reported to WHO from Poland, Switzerland, Sweden, and Ireland. Advice to health-care professionals, regulatory authorities and the public Health-care professionals should report adverse effects, lack of expected effects, or suspected falsification to the National Regulatory Authorities or National Pharmacovigilance Centre. If an overdose from OXYCONTIN is suspected (especially from a product bought on the informal market), be aware that nitazene poisoning is a possibility. WHO advises increased surveillance and diligence in supply chains and the informal market in countries/regions likely to be affected. Authorities should notify WHO immediately if these falsified products are detected in their country. WHO advises against using these products. If you or someone you know has used them or experienced adverse effects, seek immediate medical advice or contact a poison control center. All medical products must be obtained from authorized/licensed suppliers. If you have any information about the manufacture or supply of these falsified products, please contact WHO via rapidalert@who.int. Annex: Products subject of WHO Medical Product Alert N°1 /2025"

    "publishedDate": "10 October 2024",
    "content": "Alert Summary This WHO Alert refers to falsified DOW USP/EP PROPYLENE GLYCOL detected in Pakistan in August 2024 and notified to WHO in September 2024. Authentic DOW USP/EP PROPYLENE GLYCOL is a raw material (excipient) utilized in pharmaceutical and other manufacturing processes, adhering to the standards of the United States and European Pharmacopoeias (USP/EP) for medicinal use. Background In April 2024, WHO also issued Medical Product Alert No.1/2024 concerning the detection of five batches of falsified and contaminated DOW USP/EP PROPYLENE GLYCOL which had been detected in Pakistan and linked to the manufacture of contaminated oral liquid medicines. The falsified PROPYLENE GLYCOL had been found to be contaminated with ethylene glycol. WHO has now received information concerning three new falsified batches of DOW USP/EP PROPYLENE GLYCOL which were detected in Pakistan in August 2024. WHO shared this information with the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) which issued a national rapid alert on 22 August 2024, detailing these new falsified batches of DOW USP/EP PROPYLENE GLYCOL. See DRAP ALERT No: I/S/8-24-29. On 6 September 2024, DRAP issued a further rapid alert concerning contamination with ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol in five locally produced oral liquid medicines. See DRAP ALERT No: I/S/9-24-32. In September 2024, DOW confirmed that the materials detailed in the DRAP alert and identified in this WHO alert are falsified and were not manufactured or supplied by DOW. All three batch numbers listed on the labels of the containers are also falsified. At least one falsified DOW certificate of analysis for one of the batches was also identified. On 8 October 2024, DRAP confirmed to WHO that laboratory analysis of the falsified DOW Propylene Glycol USP/EP, batch F8900L8PPD6, found it was contaminated with Ethylene Glycol at 0.7624% v/v. The PROPYLENE GLYCOL materials identified in this alert have been deliberately and fraudulently falsified to misrepresent their identity and source. The quality and safety of these falsified materials cannot be assured. The falsified materials may have also been offered for sale online and have been distributed to other countries, including through informal or unregulated markets. Manufacturers of oral liquid medicines may have purchased these contaminated raw materials, which may still be in their storage facilities. Please refer to Annex 1 of this alert for full details of the affected products and Annex 2 for available photographs. Risks The falsified raw materials referenced in this alert should be considered as unsafe and should not be used in the manufacture of medical products or any products intended for human use. They may be contaminated with unknown substances such as, but not limited to, diethylene glycol (DEG) and or ethylene glycol (EG). Toxic effects of consumption of such contaminants can include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, inability to pass urine, headache, altered mental state, and acute kidney injury which may lead to death. WHO has previously published seven Alerts on oral liquid medicines contaminated with DEG and or EG. Please see: Medical Product Alert No.6/2022, Medical Product Alert No.7/2022, Medical Product Alert No.1/2023, Medical Product Alert No.4/2023, Medical Product Alert No.5/2023, Medical Product Alert No.6/2023, and Medical Product Alert N°8/2023. Advice to manufacturers, distributors, and regulatory authorities Manufacturers of medicines should ensure that raw materials are acquired from qualified and approved suppliers. Manufacturers of oral liquid medicines, especially syrups containing raw materials at risk of contamination with EG and/or DEG, e.g. propylene glycol, sorbitol, and/or glycerin/glycerol, are urged to follow WHO good manufacturing practice requirements. Manufacturers are also advised to test each batch of incoming raw materials for ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol before using as excipients in the production of liquid medicines. Analytical methods have been developed for testing liquid preparations for oral use for possible contamination with DEG/EG. Gas Chromatography (GC) is a suitable and widely used analytical technique. In case of lack of access to GC, WHO recommends a two-level approach in which suspicious samples are first screened to identify contamination using a semi-quantitative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) method as per the International Pharmacopoeia. The suspected contaminated products may then be confirmed by GC. WHO advises against distributing or promoting any finished products that may have been manufactured using falsified raw materials. If such products have already been distributed and consumed, it is crucial to urge and guide patients to promptly seek medical advice from a healthcare professional. WHO requests increased surveillance and diligence within the supply chains of countries and regions likely to be impacted by the sourcing of these raw materials. Increased surveillance of the informal/unregulated market is also advised. National regulatory authorities/health authorities are advised to immediately notify WHO if substandard/falsified raw materials are discovered in their country. Healthcare professionals should report any adverse events suspected to be linked to the use of contaminated medicines to the National Regulatory Authorities/National Pharmacovigilance Centre. Patients who experience adverse reactions or unexpected side-effects after using suspected contaminated products should also seek immediate medical attention from a healthcare professional. If you have any information about the manufacture, use or supply of these falsified and contaminated raw materials, please contact WHO via rapidalert@who.int."

Please see Medical Product Alert No.6/2022, Medical Product Alert No.7/2022, Medical Product Alert No.1/2023, Medical Product Alert No.4/2023, Medical Product Alert No.5/2023, Medical Product Alert No.6/2023 and WHO Medical Product Alert N°8/2023. Following WHO Medical Product Alert N°8/2023 Product Alert N°8/2023 in December 2023, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) investigated potential contamination of oral liquid medicines. Suspect drums of PROPYLENE GLYCOL were identified by DRAP, and samples were tested by Pakistan’s Central Drugs Laboratory. The analyses revealed unacceptable levels of ethylene glycol contamination, ranging from 0.76% to 100%. Between January and March 2024, DRAP issued three Rapid Alerts regarding five contaminated batches of DOW USP/EP PROPYLENE GLYCOL. DRAP Alert No I/S/01-24-02 (11 Jan 2024) DRAP Alert No I/S/02-24-11 (7 March 24) DRAP Alert No I/S/03-24-14 (11 March 2024) DOW has confirmed that the raw materials detailed in the DRAP Alerts, and identified in this WHO Alert are falsified and were not manufactured or supplied by DOW. The quality and safety of these excipients therefore cannot be assured. The PROPYLENE GLYCOL materials identified in this Alert are considered to have been deliberately and fraudulently mislabelled. They contain high levels of ethylene glycol, which if ingested can be toxic. These raw materials may have been distributed to other countries, including through informal or unregulated markets. Manufacturers of oral liquid medicines may have unknowingly purchased these contaminated raw materials, which may still be in their storage facilities. Please refer to Annex 1 of this Alert for full details of the affected products and Annex 2 for available photographs. Risks Ethylene glycol is toxic to humans when consumed and can prove fatal. The falsified raw materials referenced in this Alert should be considered as unsafe and their use in medical products may result in serious injury or death, particularly in children. Toxic effects can include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, inability to pass urine, headache, altered mental state, and acute kidney injury which may lead to death. Advice to manufacturers, distributors, and regulatory authorities Manufacturers of medicines should ensure that raw materials are acquired from qualified and approved suppliers. Manufacturers of oral liquid medicines, especially syrups containing raw materials at risk of contamination with ethylene glycol (EG) and/or diethylene glycol (DEG), e.g. propylene glycol, sorbitol, and/or glycerin/glycerol, are urged to follow WHO good manufacturing practice requirements. Manufacturers are also advised to test each batch of incoming raw materials for ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol before using as excipients in the production of liquid medicines. Analytical methods have been developed for testing paediatric medicines contaminated with DEG/EG. Gas Chromatography (GC) is a suitable and widely used analytical technique. In case of lack of access to GC, in the International Pharmacopoeia WHO recommends a two-level approach in which suspicious samples are first screened to quickly identify contamination using a semi-quantitative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) method. The suspected contaminated products may then be confirmed by GC. WHO advises against distributing or promoting any finished products that may have been manufactured using the potentially affected raw materials, without undergoing further testing. If such products have already been distributed and consumed, it is crucial to urge and guide patients to promptly seek medical advice from a healthcare professional. WHO requests increased surveillance and diligence within the supply chains of countries and regions likely to be affected by these affected raw materials. Increased surveillance of the informal/unregulated market is also advised. National regulatory authorities/health authorities are advised to immediately notify WHO if substandard/falsified raw materials are discovered in their respective country. Healthcare professionals should report any cases of adverse events suspected to be linked to the use of contaminated medicines to the National Regulatory Authorities/National Pharmacovigilance Centre. Patients who experience adverse reactions or unexpected side effects after using suspected contaminated products should also seek immediate medical attention from a healthcare professional. If you have any information about the manufacture, use or supply of these falsified and contaminated raw materials, please contact WHO via rapidalert@who.int.

    "content": "Alert Summary This WHO Medical Product Alert refers to five different syrup and suspension medicines initially detected in the Maldives and Pakistan and notified to WHO on 8 November 2023. Some of the affected products have also been detected in Belize, Fiji and Lao People’s Democratic Republic. The five products are ALERGO Syrup, EMIDONE Suspension, MUCORID Syrup, ULCOFIN Suspension and ZINCELL Syrup. A total of 23 batches of these products are affected. The stated manufacturer of all the affected products is PHARMIX LABORATORIES (PVT.) LTD (Pakistan). In November 2023, samples of five different batches of ALERGO syrup were screened for non-compliance by the quality control laboratory of the Maldives Food and Drug Authority (MFDA) in accordance with the thin layer chromatography (TLC) test for Diethylene Glycol and Ethylene Glycol for inclusion in The International Pharmacopoeia. The routine screening detected potentially unacceptable amounts of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol as contaminants. Laboratory testing conducted by the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia confirmed that all five batches were contaminated with ethylene glycol at levels ranging from 0.62 to 0.82% w/w relative to the accepted limit of not more than 0.10% w/w. A follow-on inspection of PHARMIX LABORATORIES (PVT.) LTD was conducted by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP). DRAP’s review of the manufacturing facility and manufacturing records suggests that diethylene glycol/ethylene glycol as contaminants may be present in other products and batches manufactured by PHARMIX LABORATORIES (PVT.) LTD. The safety and quality of these products can, therefore, not be guaranteed. As a precautionary measure, PHARMIX LABORATORIES has been instructed by DRAP to stop production of all oral liquid dosage medicines, and on 16 November 2023, DRAP issued a Recall Alert for five different syrup medicines manufactured by PHARMIX LABORATORIES.

    "content": "Alert Summary This WHO Medical Product Alert refers to one batch of substandard (contaminated) METHOTREXTM (methotrexate) 50mg, identified in two countries (Yemen and Lebanon) in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region. Methotrexate is on the WHO model list of essential medicines and is indicated for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Substandard medical products are products that fail to meet either their quality standards or specifications and are, therefore \"out of specification\"[1]. Following adverse events in pediatric patients receiving METHOTREXTM 50mg, the health authorities in both Yemen and Lebanon conducted microbiological testing on the remaining unopened vials of METHOTREXTM 50mg. Results in both countries were positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating contamination of the products. The stated manufacturer, CELON Laboratories Pvt Ltd., has confirmed to WHO that the batch number, manufacturing, and expiry dates combination referenced above match their internal records. At this stage, they have not had access to samples of the suspect products for their own confirmatory testing. [1] WHO definitions: https://www.who.int/teams/regulation-prequalification/incidents-and-SF/background/definitions Risks Methotrexate is a chemotherapy agent and immune system suppressant. It may be given by intrathecal, intramuscular, intravenous, or intra-arterial routes. Patients receiving methotrexate treatment may have weakened immune systems and be more vulnerable to opportunistic infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream infection is a serious infection that may lead to death and any product that has any contamination and is administered directly in the body would present serious risks to patients. METHOTREXTM 50mg batch MTI2101BAQ was intended to be sold exclusively on the Indian market. METHOTREXTM 50mg batch MTI2101BAQ available in Yemen and Lebanon was procured outside the regulated supply chain. Therefore, the stated manufacturer cannot guarantee the safety of this product which was not destined for these markets. However, it is likely that this product may have been distributed to other countries through informal markets. It is important to detect and remove this contaminated product from circulation to prevent harm to patients. Advice to regulatory authorities and the public WHO requests increased surveillance and diligence within the supply chains of countries and regions likely to be affected by this product. Increased surveillance of the informal/unregulated market is also advised. Competent authorities are advised to immediately notify the WHO if this product is discovered in their respective market. Manufacturers are urged to test for microbial contamination before releasing finished product batches for use. All medical products must be approved and obtained from authorized/licensed suppliers. The products’ authenticity and physical condition should be carefully checked. Seek advice from a healthcare professional when in doubt. If you have these substandard products, please DO NOT use them.

    "content": "Alert Summary This WHO Medical Product Alert refers to falsified COVID-19 VACCINE AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) identified in the Islamic Republic of Iran and reported to WHO in October 2021. The genuine manufacturer of COVID-19 VACCINE AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) has indicated that the product is falsified. The falsified product was reported at the patient level outside authorized and regulated supply chains and authorized immunization programmes in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The falsified products are illicitly refilled vials of used and discarded genuine COVID-19 VACCINE AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]). The metal cap on samples of these falsified products displays evidence of tampering, indicating the metal cap was removed in order to refill the vials, and later replaced onto the vial. These falsified products are difficult to detect – as they may appear indistinguishable from genuine AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) vaccine. There is therefore a risk they could be illicitly or accidentally inserted into the regulated supply chain or authorized immunization programme. Table 1: Products subject of WHO Medical Product Alert N°7/2021 Risks Inappropriate or insecure disposal of vaccine vials creates a risk that empty vials are refilled to produce falsified COVID-19 vaccines. WHO recommends heightened scrutiny and awareness in the purchasing and distribution of vaccines and calls for the secure and appropriate disposal of empty vials. Genuine COVID-19 VACCINE AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The use of genuine COVID-19 vaccines should be in accordance with official guidance from national regulatory authorities. Falsified COVID-19 vaccines pose a serious risk to global public health and place an additional burden on vulnerable populations and health systems. The risk to patient health from falsified COVID-19 vaccines includes delayed immunization against COVID-19 and could be life-threatening in some circumstances. It is important to detect and remove any falsified COVID-19 vaccines in circulation to prevent harm to patients. Advice to regulatory authorities and the public Reused and refilled vials may sometimes be identified by physical examination. Some indicators that a vial is falsified and may have been illicitly refilled may include: vials have scratches or signs of tampering labels show signs of damage the metal cap is dented, scratched or broken rubber seals are scratched or punctured foreign materials/particles visible inside the vial visible signs that the expiry date has been changed or tampered with the expiry date does not match the authentic batch number the product is available for private sale outside of authorized immunization programmes. WHO requests increased vigilance within the supply chains of countries and regions likely to be affected by these falsified products. Increased vigilance should include hospitals, clinics, health centres, wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, and any other suppliers of medical products. All medical products, including COVID-19 vaccines, must be obtained from authorized/licensed suppliers and authorized immunization programmes. The products’ authenticity and physical condition should be carefully checked. Seek advice from a healthcare professional in case of doubt.

    "content": "Falsified VITAMIN A (retinol) identified in WHO region of Africa Alert Summary This WHO Medical Product Alert refers to two falsified VITAMIN A (retinol) capsules identified in Chad and reported to WHO in November 2020. Laboratory analysis of recovered samples identified that both products are severely degraded and underdosed – containing less than the stated active ingredient. Both falsified products also carry now-defunct logos – the outdated WHO Essential Drugs Programme logo and the outdated Micronutrient Initiative logo. Both falsified products were supplied at patient level and may still be in circulation in the region. Vitamin A (retinol) is a micronutrient used for the prevention and treatment of vitamin A deficiency. The most severe effects of this deficiency are seen in young children. Deficiency of vitamin A is associated with significant morbidity and mortality from common childhood infections and is the world’s leading preventable cause of childhood blindness. Vitamin A deficiency also contributes to maternal mortality and other poor outcomes of pregnancy and lactation. Retinol is listed on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children. The public health threat of falsified vitamin A (retinol) particularly affects vulnerable children already suffering from vitamin A deficiency. It is important to detect and remove any falsified vitamin A (retinol) from circulation so as to prevent harm to patients. The products identified in this Alert are confirmed falsified on the basis that they deliberately/fraudulently misrepresent their identity, composition, or source: the variable data (batch number and expiry dates) of these products do not correspond to genuine manufacturing records; the manufacturing and expiry dates of these products have been deliberately altered to extend their shelf-life; laboratory analysis of both products have confirmed both are underdosed, severely degraded, and do not comply with specifications. Table 1: Products subject of WHO Medical Product Alert N°1/2021 Genuine VITAMIN A (RETINOL), batch UI4004, was manufactured by Accucaps Industries Limited in September 2009, with an expiry date of September 2012. The falsified product identified in the above table and shown in the photos below has been tampered with and the manufacturing and expiry dates have been altered. Laboratory analysis has determined that the capsules had degraded and contained only 68.6% of the stated active ingredient. Furthermore, two obsolete and outdated logos (WHO Essential Drugs Programme and Micronutrient Initiative) are found on the label. Genuine VITAMIN A (RETINOL) batch 39090439, was manufactured by Banner Pharmacaps (Canada) Ltd, with an expiry in 2009. The falsified product identified in the above table and shown in the photos below has been tampered with and the manufacturing and expiry dates have been altered. Laboratory analysis has determined that the capsules had degraded and contained only 64.4% of the stated active ingredient. Furthermore, two obsolete and outdated logos (WHO Essential Drugs Programme and Micronutrient Initiative) are found on the label. Advice to regulatory authorities and the public WHO requests increased vigilance within the supply chains of countries and regions likely to be affected by these falsified products.

Purpose of this notice: To request that IVD users monitor mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and their impact on diagnosis. Description of the problem: Following the detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants containing mutations, including SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01, and SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2, WHO reminds users of IVDs to monitor detection rates for SARS-CoV-2 at their site. IVD users should routinely review test results to detect unexpected increases or decreases in test results, including positivity rate, target detection rate, invalid or unreturnable result rate, etc. These variations may be early indicators of impact on the safety, quality or performance of the IVD products. Certain mutations may increase the risk of delayed diagnosis (due to inconclusive or invalid results), and misdiagnosis. Manufacturers of IVDs listed by WHO (through Emergency Use Listing) must proactively scan literature and other sources for any documented mutations that might impact the safety, quality or performance of their product. This should be incorporated as part of their post-market surveillance plan and will be supplemented by feedback reported by IVD users in the form of unexpected results, as well as other product problems and adverse events. All gathered information must be reviewed in a timely fashion, using risk management principles to determine any necessary actions. Advice on action to be taken by IVD users: IVD users should notify the IVD manufacturer in the following circumstances: Increased discrepancies in cycle threshold (Ct) values between different gene targets. Failure to detect specific gene targets, including those containing gene sequences that coincide with documented mutations. Misdiagnosis (for example, false negative). See WHO website for reporting form for IVD users to give feedback to manufacturers https://www.who.int/health-topics/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products/safety-info-medical-devices-in-vitro-diagnostics Contact person for further information: Anita SANDS, Regulation and Prequalification, World Health Organization, e-mail: rapidalert@who.int Reference: Guidance for post-market surveillance and market surveillance of medical devices, including in vitro diagnostics.

Purpose of this notice: clarify information previously provided by WHO. This notice supersedes WHO Information Notice for In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device (IVD) Users 2020/05 version 1, issued 14 December 2020. Description of the problem: WHO requests users to follow the instructions for use (IFU) when interpreting results for specimens tested using PCR methodology. Users of IVDs must read and follow the IFU carefully to determine if manual adjustment of the PCR positivity threshold is recommended by the manufacturer. WHO guidance Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 states that careful interpretation of weak positive results is needed (1). The cycle threshold (Ct) needed to detect virus is inversely proportional to the patient’s viral load. Where test results do not correspond with the clinical presentation, a new specimen should be taken and retested using the same or different NAT technology. WHO reminds IVD users that disease prevalence alters the predictive value of test results; as disease prevalence decreases, the risk of false positive increases (2). This means that the probability that a person who has a positive result (SARS-CoV-2 detected) is truly infected with SARS-CoV-2 decreases as prevalence decreases, irrespective of the claimed specificity. Most PCR assays are indicated as an aid for diagnosis, therefore, health care providers must consider any result in combination with timing of sampling, specimen type, assay specifics, clinical observations, patient history, confirmed status of any contacts, and epidemiological information. Actions to be taken by IVD users: Please read carefully the IFU in its entirety. Contact your local representative if there is any aspect of the IFU that is unclear to you. Check the IFU for each incoming consignment to detect any changes to the IFU. Provide the Ct value in the report to the requesting health care provider.

Description of the problem: Thermo Fisher Scientific identified the need to conduct a field safety corrective action to reduce the risk related to use of their product, the issues were identified through customer feedback and internal review. Issue 1: Poorly extracted patient specimens were called valid using MS2 Assay. A cycle threshold (Ct) cutoff of 37 was not adequate to detect specimens with poor extraction efficiency or a large amount of impurities post-extraction. This issue may potentially cause a weakly positive specimen that sub-optimally extracted to be falsely called a valid negative specimen, thereby constituting a false negative. However, no customer has reported false negative results due to this issue to date. Issue 2: The MS2 assay, which detects the Internal Positive Control (IPC), was erroneously called amplified in a small percentage of Positive Control (PC) samples. This issue caused a plate to be designated incorrectly as invalid, thereby requiring unnecessary retesting of an entire batch of specimens. As a result of the above two issues, Thermo Fisher Scientific recommends a mandatory upgrade for the Applied Biosystems COVID-19 Interpretive Software used with the TaqPath COVID-19 CE-IVD COVID-19 RT-PCR Kit: If you are using Applied Biosystems COVID-19 Interpretive Software v1.2 (used with the 7500 series Real-Time PCR instruments) you need to upgrade to software v1.3. If you are using Applied Biosystems COVID-19 Interpretive Software v2.1 or v2.2 (used with the QuantStudio Real-Time PCR platforms), you need to upgrade to software v2.3. Issue 3: Thermo Fisher Scientific has updated the Instructions for Use (IFU) to highlight the importance of vortexing the RT-PCR reaction plates to mitigate potential for false positive results. The vortexing instructions are detailed in the “Prepare RT-PCR reactions” step of the Instructions for Use, recorded under the publication number MAN0019215 Revision E and all translations of this publication. Thermo Fisher Scientific strongly recommends that all users participate in training on how to properly run the workflow as offered by the local representative. Advice on action to be taken by users: 1. Please check if your local representative for Thermo Fisher Scientific has communicated a field safety notice to your facility on this topic. a. If they have, please follow the instructions contained in the field safety notice specific for your regulatory jurisdiction. Thermo Fisher Scientific will provide a subscription code to access and complete e-learning. You will be required to pass an exam and acknowledge that you reviewed information to upgrade the Applied Biosystems COVID-19 Interpretive Software. b. If they have not, please contact your local representative for Thermo Fisher immediately, or the economic operator who provided you with the product. 2. Stop using Applied Biosystems COVID-19 CE-IVD Interpretive Software v1.2, v2.1 and v2.2. 3. Do not test specimens until the mandatory e-learning and software upgrade has been conducted. 4. Consider any positive result (SARS-CoV-2 detected) or negative results (SARS-CoV-2 not detected) in combination with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information. 5. Ensure that you sign and return acknowledgement of receipt of the field safety notice issued by Thermo Fisher Scientific, as per their request.

    "content": "Date: 7 August 2020 Subject: Substandard/Falsified medical devices and personal protective equipment (PPE) used in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic WHO-identifier: 2020/3, version 1 Type of action: Advice to users of medical devices and PPE used for prevention, treatment and care for COVID-19. Attention: Users of medical devices and PPE[1], procurement entities and customs officials, national programme managers and their implementing partners, laboratories, ministry of health and national regulatory authorities for medical devices and PPE. Purpose: To advise on actions to be taken to identify and prevent circulation of substandard/falsified medical devices and PPE for COVID-19. Description of the problem: WHO continues to be made aware of circulation of substandard/falsified medical devices and PPE for prevention of COVID-19 and in the treatment and case management of people with COVID-19. WHO uses the following definitions: Substandard, also called \"out of specification\", are authorized medical devices that fail to meet either their quality or safety performance specifications. Falsified medical device that deliberately/fraudulently misrepresent their identity, composition or source. Unregistered/unlicensed medical devices that have not undergone evaluation and/or approval by the national regulatory authority for the market in which they are marketed/distributed or used, subject to permitted conditions under national regulation and legislation. Any adverse event or product problem for a medical device may reveal that a product is substandard or falsified. Advice on action to be taken by buyers/donors of medical devices and PPE for COVID-19: Purchase products that have been authorized/approved/listed by the responsible institution: the national regulatory authority (NRA) or any other institution that has the mandate to oversee quality, safety and performance of such medical devices and PPE in your country. Review registration status by checking your NRA’s website for lists/databases of authorized/approved/listed products, and list of withdrawn/non-approved products. If such information is not publicly available on their websites, communication with your NRA is encouraged. Ensure donated medical devices and PPE are registered (see WHO guidelines). Purchase products from the legal manufacturer, or their designated economic operator (agent, distributor, supplier, authorized representative). Request from the manufacturer if any obsolescence plans are in place. Advice on action to be taken by users of medical devices and PPE for COVID-19: Follow guidance from WHO on appropriate use of medical devices for COVID-19 T and use technical specifications provided by WHO or the final user to select the appropriate, safe and qualified medical device. Avoid purchasing medical devices online from an unknown source. Request a copy of the certificate of safety and performance depending on the functionality of the product from the manufacturer for each lot/serial number of product. Cross-reference the labelling of product received against your NRA’s authorization/approval/listing letter and labelling on your NRA’s website and the manufacturer’s website. Conduct incoming inspection for certain categories of medical devices. Read the instructions for use to understand the intended use of the product and taking note of any limitations. Ascertain, within reasonable doubt, that the product is genuine. Contact WHO, if in doubt[2]. Run all required calibration and preventive maintenance procedures as instructed by the manufacturer in their instructions for use and operation manuals. Report any product problems and/or adverse events as complaints to the manufacturer as soon as you become aware using a complaint form and copy to WHO and your NRA. The contact details for the manufacturer can be found in both primary and secondary packaging materials and instructions for use. Adverse events may be: Death of the patient, end-user or any other person occurred or may have occurred Death of the patient, end-user or any other person occurred or may have occurred Product problems may be: Packaging – damaged, defective, suspect tampered Labelling – insufficient instructions for use, illegible Sampling – device does not collect/transfer specimen Liquid – leak, splash Mechanical – misalignment, jam Electrical – unable to charge, power loss or fluctuation Data – capture, display, or storage affecting product functionality Software – network, program, algorithm, or security affecting product functionality Environmental – noise, temperature, humidity/moisture, fungal/bacterial growth, or dust affecting product functionality Failure to calibrate Increased rate of invalid or unreturnable test results Obviously incorrect, inadequate or imprecise result or readings Unable to obtain reading Advice for action to be taken by national regulators of medical devices and PPE for COVID-19: Assess products (full assessment or through reliance/recognition mechanisms) and share approval/authorization/listing on your website or any other platform which is accessible to stakeholders. Ensure such assessment is conducted before issuance of import permit for non-domestically manufactured product. Conduct inspection of imported products in collaboration with customs officials at the point of entry to detect substandard/falsified devices and products. The following information can be checked; import certificate issued by the NRA, certificate of analysis (translated) which needs to be compared with the imported products. Physical examination of products including labelling information and details of the importer (authorized representatives or approved suppliers), matching of product details with certificate of analysis, evidence of tampering of labels, language, product description such as size, shape, colour, product code and batch, cracks, abrasion, erosion, breaks and seal integrity. Collect samples for further investigation if there is any suspicion about the product and take appropriate regulatory actions such as quarantine and testing. Ensure that users are aware that they should report any adverse event and product problems to the manufacturer. Post field safety notices issued by manufacturers for medical devices and PPE supplied within your jurisdiction on your website. Exchange information with other regulators if your market surveillance detects product problems or adverse events. Note: For many jurisdictions, emergency use/approval mechanisms have been put in place for certain medical devices. These products should be the subject of increased monitoring by device users for adverse events and product problems.

    "publishedDate": "9 April 2020",
    "content": "UPDATE (of 9 June 2020) to Medical Product Alert n°4/2020 This Medical Product Alert relates to several confirmed falsified chloroquine products circulating in the WHO regions of Africa and Europe. New reports of falsified chloroquine which have been validated by WHO are included in this update. Between 31 March and 2 April 2020, the WHO global surveillance and monitoring system on substandard and falsified (SF) medical products received 14 reports of confirmed falsified chloroquine products from 5 countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, France, and Niger. All reported products were identified at patient level and all have been confirmed as falsified. Widespread vigilance is required from all countries, regardless of where the product was originally identified. All the products (with photographs) listed in the annex are confirmed as falsified, on the basis that they deliberately/fraudulently misrepresent their identity, composition or source. Indeed, it can be noted that: either: the products do not contain the correct amount of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, based on the results of preliminary or full compendial analysis; and/or: the products were not produced by the manufacturer whose name is stated on the product labels, and the variable data (batch number and dates) of the above products do not correspond to genuine manufacturing records; and/or: the manufacturer whose name is stated on the product labels does not exist. Chloroquine phosphate or sulfate is referenced on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection (malaria). Large clinical trials are under way to generate the robust data needed to establish the efficacy and safety of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19. These medicines are currently authorized for malaria and certain autoimmune diseases and it is important that patients do not face shortages caused by stockpiling or use outside the authorized indications. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can have serious side effects, especially at high doses or when combined with other medicines. The SOLIDARITY trial, led by WHO, is reviewing potential treatments for COVID-19. Please refer to WHO medical product alert n°3/2020 for general information on falsified medical products in relation to the management of COVID-19. WHO requests increased vigilance within the supply chains of countries likely to be affected by these falsified products. Increased vigilance should include hospitals, clinics, health centres, wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies and any other suppliers of medical products. All medical products must be obtained from licensed, authentic and reliable sources. Their authenticity and condition should be carefully checked. Seek advice from a healthcare professional in case of doubt. If you are in possession of the above products, please do not use.

    "publishedDate": "31 March 2020",
    "content": "This Medical Product Alert warns consumers, healthcare professionals, and health authorities against a growing number of falsified medical products that claim to prevent, detect, treat or cure COVID-19. The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic (caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2) has increased demand for medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and reagents, all related to COVID-19, creating an opportunity for ill-intended persons to distribute falsified medical products Due diligence is required from all actors in the procurement, use and administration of medical products, in particular those affected by the current crisis of, or related to, COVID-19. 1. FALSIFIED IN VITRO DIAGNOSTICS AND LABORATORY REAGENTS WHO has received multiple reports regarding falsified in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) and laboratory reagents for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Please refer to WHO’s Emergency Use Listing for a list of diagnostics approved for clinical use by WHO. To date, eight countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, PR China, Russian Federation, Singapore, Republic of Korea, United States of America) have listed IVDs for COVID-19 diagnosis based on expedited regulatory assessments. Please note that, in the European Union, regulatory compliance for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics are self-declared by the manufacturer. To assist Member States and stakeholders, WHO has published the links to these emergency lists, together with contact details. These links provide information on IVDs authorized for use in the jurisdictions of the International Medical Device Regulators Forum, as well as policies and guidance. WHO will provide updated versions as new information becomes available. End-users are encouraged to check the labelling against the information posted by regulatory authorities upon listing to ensure they are in possession of the genuine product. This information might include product name, product code, expiry date, instructions for use and manufacturer details. 2. FALSIFIED MEDICINES AND VACCINES At this stage, WHO does not recommend any medicines to treat or cure COVID-19. However, the SOLIDARITY trial, led by WHO, is reviewing potential treatments for COVID-19. At this stage, there is no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. Products claiming to be vaccines to prevent COVID-19 may be considered falsified and may pose significant risks to public health. Unregulated websites supplying medicines and/or vaccines, particularly those concealing their physical address or landline telephone number, are frequently the source of unlicensed, substandard and falsified medical products. WHO has been made aware of various unregistered websites claiming that products on sale can treat or prevent COVID-19. Such products are likely to be falsified medicines. In addition, some websites may appear to provide easy access to legitimate medicines that are otherwise not readily available. End-buyers and consumers should be especially wary of such online scams and exert due-diligence when purchasing any medical product, whether online or not. WHO requests increased vigilance from national health authorities, healthcare professionals, members of the public and supply chain stakeholders worldwide to prevent the distribution of these falsified medical products. Increased vigilance should focus on hospitals, clinics, health centres, clinical laboratories, wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies and any other suppliers of medical products. All medical products must be obtained from authentic and reliable sources. Their authenticity and condition of the product should be carefully checked. Consumers are advised to seek advice from a healthcare professional in case of doubt. National health authorities are requested to immediately notify WHO if these falsified products are discovered in their country.

Both falsified products are presented in clear glass ampoules and falsely claim to be manufactured for Tillotts Pharma AG. Circulation of these falsified medical products is confirmed in the WHO Region of the Eastern Mediterranean. Falsified product n°1: GULUCATIME In January 2019, WHO was informed that a product called GULUCATIME was available at patient level in Iran. This product claims to be manufactured for Tillotts Pharma AG; verification by WHO confirmed that the product is falsified. It is presented in carton packs each containing five ampoules.

Falsified product n°2: GLUCANTIME In March 2019, WHO was informed that a similar product called GLUCANTIME was available at patient level in Pakistan. This product also claims to be manufactured for Tillots Pharma AG and is confirmed falsified. Available photographs suggest the label is in English language only. Product details are listed in Table 1 below. Table 1: Details of the falsified products GULUCATIME and GLUCANTIME, subject of WHO medical product alert N°7/2019 The results of laboratory analysis facilitated by WHO indicate that the product GULUCATIME was not manufactured in accordance to good manufacturing practices.

    "content": "This Medical Product Alert relates to confirmed falsified hydrochlorothiazide that has been found to contain glibenclamide instead of hydrochlorothiazide, circulating in the WHO region of Africa. Adverse effects attributed to these products have been reported. Genuine hydrochlorothiazide is used as an antihypertensive and diuretic medicine, whereas glibenclamide is an antidiabetic medicine. In March 2019, WHO was informed by a nongovernmental organization in Cameroon that a medicine presenting as hydrochlorothiazide 50mg had caused hypoglycaemia in patients. Preliminary testing indicated that the product did not contain any of the stated active ingredient, hydrochlorothiazide, and glibenclamide had instead been identified. Verification with the stated manufacturer confirmed this product to be falsified. The local health authorities were informed of this incident. Table 1: Details of the falsified product hydrochlorothiazide 50mg, subject of WHO medical product alert N°6/2019 This product is presented in plastic containers of 1000 tablets each. The label is in French and English languages. Further confirmatory laboratory analysis has established that the above-mentioned product: does not contain any of the expected active ingredient, hydrochlorothiazide, but contains approximately 5mg of glibenclamide. This represents a risk for patients who are taking hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of hypertension. It should be noted that hypoglycaemia in patients in Cameroon has been attributed to the use of the above-referenced hydrochlorothiazide with batch number 16G04. The label on the plastic container of this product states Sterop as the manufacturer. However, this company has confirmed to WHO that: it did not manufacture or supply the above product, and the batch number, as well as a number of other features shown on the label, do not correspond to genuine manufacturing records. WHO requests increased vigilance within the supply chains of countries likely to be affected by this falsified medical product. Increased vigilance should include hospitals, clinics, health centres, wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies and any other suppliers of medical products.

    "publishedDate": "18 July 2018",
    "content": "Medicines containing valsartan are used to treat patients with high blood pressure to reduce complications such as heart attack and stroke. It is also used in patients who have had heart failure or a recent heart attack. Following the identification of an unexpected impurity discovered in valsartan produced by Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceuticals, Linhai, China, EU Member States, USA, and a number of other countries have recalled medicines containing valsartan supplied by Zhejiang Huahai as a precautionary measure. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also launched a review of medicines in the EU containing valsartan supplied by Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceuticals. The impurity discovered is N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer). The presence of NDMA is suspected to be related to changes in the way the active pharmaceutical ingredient was manufactured. All batches of valsartan manufactured by Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceuticals since July 2012 are expected to be affected. EMA’s review will investigate the levels of NDMA in medicines containing valsartan manufactured by Zhejiang Huahai, its possible impact on patients who have been taking them and what measures can be taken to reduce or eliminate the impurity from future batches produced by the company. As a precaution, the review will also consider whether other valsartan medicines may be affected. National medicine regulatory authorities worldwide are requested to identify manufacturers that produce medicines containing valsartan for their markets and establish if the active pharmaceutical ingredient was supplied by Zhejiang Huahai. If so, consideration should be given to the precautionary recall of the medicines. In the case that a recall leads to a local shortage of valsartan-containing medicinal products, ensuring the availability of a different anti-hypertensive medicine should be considered as an option. EMA has advised, while further assessment is needed, there is no immediate risk and patients taking valsartan are advised not to stop their treatments unless they have been advised to do so by their pharmacist or doctor. Healthcare professionals should follow specific advice from national authorities concerning medicines in their country. The World Health Organization will update this alert as more information emerges from the review being conducted by the EMA. Further information is available on the EMA website or contact rapidalert@who.int."

    "content": "This Medical Product Alert relates to the confirmed circulation of falsified versions of Diazepam tablets circulating in Central Africa. Since December 2014, over 400 patients in the north east region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have suffered from an acute dystonic reaction affecting the muscles of the face, neck and tongue. This reaction usually lasts, without treatment, for between 3 to 4 days, sometimes re-occurs, and has resulted in up to 40 hospital admissions per week. A detailed investigation carried out in DRC has revealed that patients had been taking Diazepam to treat a wide range of illnesses. PRODUCT ONE Laboratory analysis of a product labelled as Diazepam has shown that it does not contain Diazepam, but contains between 10mg to 20mg of Haloperidol per tablet. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic and is used primarily for the treatment of schizophrenia, and one of the known side effects is acute dystonic reactions affecting the face and neck. So far, all known patients suffering a reaction have recovered. However, the levels of Haloperidol present in the tablets represent a serious risk, particularly to the young. Details and photographs of the product are available here. This product is circulating in the Ituri Health District of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the adverse reactions have been focused in the vicinity of Nono. WHO is requesting urgent vigilance for these tablets and careful examination of the contents of bottles marked SOLINA, Diazepam 5mg, as they should not contain tablets marked with the lettering AGOG. PRODUCT TWO The following version of falsified Diazepam is also circulating in the Democratic Republic of Congo in containers of 1000 tablets. They are labelled as manufactured by AGOG Pharma Ltd, and again contain yellow tablets bearing the lettering AGOG. AGOG pharma has confirmed that this packaging and labelling is falsified and that they do not manufacture Diazepam. The tablets have not yet undergone laboratory analysis, but on the basis of confirmation that the labelling is falsified WHO request increased vigilance. Details and photographs of the product are available here. If you are in possession of the tablets shown in the photographs or containers bearing the batch number shown above please do not use them, contact a Pharmacist or Doctor as soon as possible for advice and report the incident to the National Medicines Regulatory Authority/ National Pharmacovigilance Centre.

This led to the death of approximately 50 persons in Pakistan, all with a history of drug addiction, who had been abusing dextromethorphan-containing syrups for many years without any reported unexpected adverse reactions. The subsequent investigation identified that both manufacturers in Pakistan were obtaining Dextromethorphan API from Konduskar Laboratories in India. More information is available here. Update On 26 September 2013, WHO HQ was notified of suspected drug intoxications involving 11 paediatric patients in Paraguay. All of the patients were experiencing influenza-like symptoms and had consumed medical products produced by a local manufacturer (INDUFAR C.S.I.A.) containing Dextromethorphan. The children were aged between 2-9 years and serious adverse reactions included altered consciousness, cyanosis, respiratory distress, and seizures. The onset of symptoms occurred between 2-7 hours after ingesting the Dextromethorphan. Since then the number of patients experiencing adverse reactions has risen to 44 confirmed cases, ranging in age from 5 months to 48 years. There has been one fatality that may be linked to this event. The Paraguayan Ministry of Health has issued warnings concerning the medicines thought to be connected to this incident.
